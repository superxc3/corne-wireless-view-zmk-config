This branch for `niceview` display.

Quick link to [Keymap Editor](https://nickcoutsos.github.io/keymap-editor/). This mouse repo seems not compatible with nickcoutsos's web keyremap anymore. You have to edit the keycodes in keymap.c instead of relying on nickcoutsos. Check [Codes](https://zmk.dev/docs/codes) for a full list of zmk keycode, you may read other interesting function in the same page.
